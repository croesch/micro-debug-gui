		Structured Computer Organization, Fourth Edition (Prentice-Hall, 1998).
		You can debug the assembler code and the micro assembler code, too.&lt;p&gt;
		This debugger has been developed for a seminar paper.&lt;p&gt;

	<entry key="gui-help-comp-descr">&lt;html&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The parts of the main
		frame&lt;/h2&gt;
		The main frame consists of different parts:
		&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;First of all there is the disassembled code in the center.
		You can see the macro and the micro code with line numbers. The line
		numbers in micro code are ongoing whereas the line numbers in the
		macro code represent the address of the command in the
		memory.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;On the upper left there are the registers,
		you can change the number format of their values by selecting a
		different radio button. By clicking the checkbox in a line of the
		register you set a breakpoint for that register
		&lt;i&gt;without&lt;/i&gt; a value.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Under the view of registers you see the content of the
		memory. Each word in memory has its own line. As in the
		register view you can select the number format
		for representing the word values of the memory.
		You see the whole memory, so you can also see
		the binary bits of the macro code or the stack for
		instance.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;At the bottom right there is a text area
		which contains output that would have gone to the command line and
		hasn't yet been put into a GUI component. So this component might be
		removed in future.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Left of that there is a text field. If its
		background is painted in a special color, the Mic1 is
		requesting input. You should enter the input
		for the processor and press ENTER. The text
		area above contains the output of the processor - of your
		program.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;</entry>

		I tried my best, but unfortunately there still might be some bugs and problems
		with using this program. If you are facing any issue with using it, don't hesitate
		to let me know! You also might have a brilliant idea what the program should be
		able to handle. If so, let me know!&lt;br&gt;
		Just visit &lt;a href="https://github.com/croesch/micro-debug-gui/issues"&gt;
		https://github.com/croesch/micro-debug-gui/issues&lt;/a&gt; and create
		an issue.

  	    If you would like to contribute to this program I'm looking forward to
  	    hearing from you! You can write me a mail or fork the project directly
  	    from github: &lt;a href="https://github.com/croesch/micro-debug-gui/"&gt;
		https://github.com/croesch/micro-debug-gui/&lt;/a&gt;
		I would be pleased if you let me know if you start working on the project.
